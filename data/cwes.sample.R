#' Sample of 100 random CWEs (Common Weakness Enummeration)
#'
#' A data set containing public information about CWE information from MITRE.

#' \describe{
#'    \item{code_standard}{CWE-XXXX}
#'    \item{ID}{The required ID attribute provides a unique identifier for the entry. It is considered static for the lifetime of the entry. If this entry becomes deprecated, the identifier will not be reused.}
#'    \item{Name}{The required Name attribute is a string that identifies the entry. The name should focus on the weakness being described and should avoid mentioning the attack that exploits the weakness or the consequences of exploiting the weakness. All words in the entry name should be capitalized except for articles and prepositions, unless they begin or end the name. Subsequent words in a hyphenated chain are also not capitalized.}
#'    \item{Abstraction}{The required Abstraction attribute defines the abstraction level for this weakness. The AbstractionEnumeration simple type defines the different abstraction levels that apply to a weakness. A "Class" is the most abstract type of weakness, typically described independent of any specific language or technology. A "Base" is a more specific type of weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. A "Variant" is a weakness that is described at a very low level of detail, typically limited to a specific language or technology. A "Compound" weakness is a meaningful aggregation of several weaknesses, currently known as either a Chain or Composite.}
#'    \item{Structure}{The required Structure attribute defines the structural nature of the weakness. The StructureEnumeration simple type lists the different structural natures of a weakness. A Simple structure represents a single weakness whose exploitation is not dependent on the presence of another weakness. A Composite is a set of weaknesses that must all be present simultaneously in order to produce an exploitable vulnerability, while a Chain is a set of weaknesses that must be reachable consecutively in order to produce an exploitable vulnerability.}
#'    \item{Status}{The required Status attribute defines the maturity of the information for this weakness. The StatusEnumeration simple type defines the different status values that an entity (view, category, weakness) can have.}
#'    \item{Description}{The required Description should be short and limited to the key points that define this weakness.}
#'    \item{Extended_Description}{The optional Extended_Description element provides a place for additional details important to this weakness, but that are not necessary to convey the fundamental concept behind the weakness. A number of other optional elements are available, each of which is described in more detail within the corresponding complexType that it references.}
#'    \item{Related_Weakness}{The RelatedWeaknessesType complex type is used to refer to other weaknesses that differ only in their level of abstraction. It contains one or more Related_Weakness elements, each of which is used to link to the CWE identifier of the other Weakness. The nature of the relation is captured by the Nature attribute. Please see the RelatedNatureEnumeration simple type definition for details about the valid value and meanings. The optional Chain_ID attribute specifies the unique ID of a named chain that a CanFollow or CanPrecede relationship pertains to. The optional Ordinal attribute is used to determine if this relationship is the primary ChildOf relationship for this weakness for a given View_ID. This attribute can only have the value "Primary" and should only be included for the primary parent/child relationship. For each unique triple of &lt;Nature, CWE_ID, View_ID&gt;, there should be only one relationship that is given a "Primary" ordinal.}
#'    \item{Weakness_Ordinality}{The WeaknessOrdinalitiesType complex type indicates potential ordering relationships with other weaknesses. A primary relationship means the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses, while a resultant relationship is when a weakness exists only in the presence of some other weaknesses. The required Ordinality element identifies whether the weakness has a primary or resultant relationship. The optional Description contains the context in which the primary or resultant relationship exists. It is important to note that it is possible for the same entry to be primary in some instances and resultant in others.}
#'    \item{Applicable_Platforms}{The ApplicablePlatformsType complex type specifies the languages, operating systems, architectures, paradigms, and technologies in which a given weakness could appear. In each case, one can specify either a specific Name or a general Class of platform. The required Prevalence attribute identifies the regularity with which the weakness is applicable to that platform. When providing an operating system name, an optional Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifier can be used to a identify a specific OS.}
#'    \item{Background_Details}{The BackgroundDetailsType complex type contains one or more Background_Detail elements, each of which contains information that is relevant but not related to the nature of the weakness itself.}
#'    \item{Alternate_Terms}{The AlternateTermsType complex type indicates one or more other names used to describe this weakness. The required Term element contains the actual alternate term. The required Description element provides context for each alternate term by which this weakness may be known.}
#'    \item{Modes_Of_Introduction}{The ModeOfIntroductionType complex type is used to provide information about how and when a given weakness may be introduced. If there are multiple possible introduction points, then a separate Introduction element should be included for each. The required Phase element identifies the point in the software life cycle at which the weakness may be introduced. The optional Note element identifies the typical scenarios under which the weakness may be introduced during the given phase.}
#'
#'    \item{cwe.parents.ids}{cwe parents ids separated by ; . Useful for graph representations.}
#'    \item{time.intro}{The Time_of_Introduction element contains the points of time in the software life cycle at which the weakness may be introduced. If there are multiple points of time at which the weakness may be introduced, then separate Introduction elements should be included for each. This element should be populated for all weakness bases and variants.}
#'    \item{consequences}{This element contains the common consequences associated with this weakness. It is populated by one or more individual Common_Consequence subelements. This should be included and completed as much as possible for all weaknesses.}
#'    \item{related.capec}{The Related_Attack_Patterns (CAPEC) element contains all references to CAPEC which will identify related attack patterns to this weakness. It has one or more Related_Attack_Pattern elements as children and each child will point to a single CAPEC entry which is associated with this weakness. This should be filled out to the extent possible for most weaknesses.}
#'    \item{exploits}{This element contains a rough estimate at the likelihood of exploitation of an exposed weakness. Many factors can impact this value which is why it should only be regarded as an approximation.}
#'    \item{ordinalities}{This element describes when this entry is primary - where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses, or when this entry might be resultant - where the weakness is typically related to the presence of some other weaknesses. The Ordinality subelement identifies whether or not we are providing context around when this entry is primary, or resultant. The Ordinality_Description contains the description of the context in which this entry is primary or resultant. It is important to note that it is possible for the same entry to be primary in some instances and resultant in others.}
#'    \item{platforms}{This structure contains the Languages, Operating_Systems, Hardware_Architectures, Architectural_Paradigms, Environments, Technology_Classes or Common Platforms on which this entry may exist. This should be filled out as much as possible for all Compound_Element and Weakness entries.}
#'    \item{aff.resources}{This element identifies system resources affected by this entry. It is populated by Affected_Resource elements.}
#'    \item{causal}{This element describes the nature of the underlying cause of the weakness. Is it an implicit underlying weakness or is it an issue of behavior on the part of the software developer? Appropriate values are either Implicit, occurring regardless of developer behavior, or Explicit, an explicit weakness resulting from behavior of the developer.}
#'    \item{mitigation}{This element contains the potential mitigations associated with this weakness. It contains one or more mitigation subelements which each represent individual mitigations for this weakness. This should be included and completed to the extent possible for all weakness bases and variants.}
