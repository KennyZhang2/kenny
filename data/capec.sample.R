#'     \item{motivation.consequences}{This element represents a container of one ore more attack motivation consequences. Attack motivation consequence represents the desired technical results that could be achieved/leveraged by this attack pattern, represented as an enumerated list of defined adversary motivations/consequences.

This information is useful for aligning attack patterns to threat models and for determining which attack patterns are relevant for a given context.}
#'     \item{injection.vector}{This element details the mechanism and format of an input-driven attack of this type. Injection vectors take into account the grammar of an attack, the syntax accepted by the system, the position of various fields, and the ranges of data that are acceptable.}
#'     \item{payload}{This element describes the code, configuration or other data to be executed or otherwise activated as part of an injection-based attack of this type.}
#'     \item{activation.zone}{This element describes the area within the target software that is capable of executing or otherwise activating the payload of an injection-based attack of this type.

#'     \item{related.cwes}{This element represents a container of one or more related weaknesses. Related weaknesses refer to software weaknesses potentially targeted for exploit by this attack pattern. USAGE: This element is used to reference industry standard Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) data, including weaknesses that are exploited by the attack as well as weaknesses whose presence increases the likelihood or impact of the attack.}
#'     \item{related.cves}{This element represents a container of one or more related vulnerabilities. A related vulnerability refers to a specific instance vulnerability targeted for exploit by this attack pattern. USAGE: This element is used to identify specific vulnerabilities by their industry-standard Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) numbers and/or US-CERT numbers. As vulnerabilities are much more specific and localized than weaknesses, it is uncommon that an attack pattern would target a specific vulnerability. This would most likely occur if the attack pattern were targeting vulnerabilities in the underlying platform, framework, or software library.}

A related guideline represents a security guideline that is relevant to identifying or mitigating this type of attack. USAGE: It would be helpful to provide a usage reference. However links to security principle and guideline documentation on the BSI site appear to be broken. NIST SP 800-27 uses the terms principle and guideline interchangeably.}
